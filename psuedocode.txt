The project starts as below:
-Thinkg of number btn 1-100: the number will be choosen at random e.g. 20
-Difficulty level: easy = 10 chances and hard = 5 chances
-Lets say one chose hard
-if choice is greater than number
-         too high, chance minus 1
-         go back to line 2
-elif choice is lower than number
-         too low, try again
-          go back to line 2, chance minus 1
-else
-     chose is equal to number
-       you got it, number
